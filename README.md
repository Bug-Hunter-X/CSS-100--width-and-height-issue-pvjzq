# CSS 100% Width and Height Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using `width: 100%;` and `height: 100%;` in CSS.  The problem arises when the parent element does not have explicit dimensions set.  In such cases, the child element might not render as expected, often collapsing to zero width and height.

The `bug.css` file shows the problematic CSS, while `solution.css` provides a solution.
