The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

The issue is that `100%` for both `width` and `height` is relative to its containing element. If the parent element doesn't have explicitly defined dimensions, this can result in the div having zero width and height.
