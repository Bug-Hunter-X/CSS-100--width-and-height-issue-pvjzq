To solve this, you need to ensure that the parent element has defined dimensions.  Here are two approaches:

1. **Set explicit dimensions on the parent:**

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px;
  height: 300px;
}

div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: lightblue; /* For visual clarity */
}
```

2. **Use `vh` and `vw` units:** 
This makes the div take up the percentage of the viewport's height and width.

```css
div {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: lightblue; /* For visual clarity */
}
```
Choose the approach that best suits your layout needs.
